I catched some ideas from...
- [lina0322/42seoul_minishell](https://github.com/lina0322/42seoul_minishell) -> take a roadmap idea
- [Build Your Own Shell using Rust](https://www.joshmcguigan.com/blog/build-your-own-shell-rust/) -> how to in Rust
- [Shell search PATH – finding and running commands](http://teaching.idallen.com/cst8207/13w/notes/400_search_path.html)

See the [open issues](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
